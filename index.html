    <h2 id="tribute-info">Leroy was an exception to the rule.
    He broke a lot of the rules like leading without followers, teaching without students and preaching without faith.
    He was the type of person you could show your darkened soul to without judgement because within all of us is a light, a reason and a purpose. 
    He is survived by his beautiful wife and excepional son as he would always say. One hundred percent! If you get it you get it.
